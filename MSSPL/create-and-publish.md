# Hands-on Lab: Create and Publish Power BI Dashboards & Reports

### Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## 📘 Scenario

In this lab, you will work with an existing report to publish it to the **Microsoft Power BI Service** and create an **interactive dashboard** by pinning important visuals. You will customize dashboard layouts, enable map visuals, and explore features such as drill-through, Q&A, quick insights, alerts, and bookmarks to improve report navigation and data storytelling. By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have a fully organized dashboard for analyzing business performance and sharing insights with stakeholders.

## 📖 Overview

In this lab, you'll use a pre-built Power BI report to publish it to the Power BI Service and create a dashboard by pinning key visuals. You'll explore features such as customizing the dashboard layout, enabling map visuals, and working with drill-through, quick insights, Q&A, alerts, and bookmarks to enhance the report experience.

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

## Task 3: Organize dashboard

In this task, you will organize the Power BI dashboard by resizing tiles, adding images, renaming visuals, generating insights, setting alerts, using drill-through, and exploring bookmarks.

1. Resize and move the **gauge** tile as shown in the screenshot.

1. Click the bottom right corner of the tile and move it diagonally to change the image size.

    ![02](../Images/image216.png)
  
    Tiles can be of various sizes (1x1 to 5x5). Drag the tile using the bottom right corner to resize it. 

1. Click the **Edit (1)** dropdown in the top-right corner of the dashboard and select **+ Add a tile (2)**.

    ![](../Images/image217.png)

1. On the **Add a tile** dialog box, click **Image (1)** as the source and select **Next (2)**.

    ![](../Images/image218.png)

1. In the Add image tile dialog box, enter the **URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CharlesSterling/DiadManu/master/Vanarsdel.png` **(1)** and click **Apply (2)**.

    ![02](../Images/image219.png)

   > 📌 **Note:** The URL is case sensitive.

1. Notice that a new tile with the **VANARSDEL** logo is added to the dashboard.

    ![](../Images/new-create-publish-powerbi-march-18.png)
  
1. Resize and rearrange the tiles as shown in the screenshot.

    ![](../Images/new-create-publish-powerbi-march-19.png)

1. The **Revenue by Country** tile shows Revenue by Country for VanArsdel, let’s rename it. Hover over **Revenue by Country** tile.

    ![](../Images/image300a.png)

1. Click the ellipsis **(...) (1)** in the top right corner of the tile and then click **Edit details (2)**. The **Tile Details** dialog box opens.

    ![](../Images/pb44.png)

1. On the **Tile Details** page, Change the **Title** to **VanArsdel Revenue (1)** then click **Apply (2)**

    ![](../Images/pb45.png)

1. Now, let’s create a visual that represents Market Share by country.

1. Notice at the top of the visual, there’s an **Ask a question about your data** option, which works just like the *Ask a question feature on the desktop*, allowing you to interact with your data using natural language queries.

   ![](../Images/pr24.png)

1. In the text box, start typing **VanArsdel market share (1)** then click arrow icon **-> (2)**. Notice that a card visual is created.

   ![](../Images/image301.png)

1. Continue typing **VanArsdel market share by country (1)** then click arrow icon **-> (2)**. Notice that a bar chart is created.

   ![](../Images/pr26.png)

1. Continue typing **VanArsdel market share by country as treemap (1)** then click arrow icon **-> (2)**. Notice that a treemap visual is created.

    ![](../Images/new-create-publish-powerbi-march-21.png)
  
    > 📌 **Note:** Remember that we renamed our tables. One of the reasons we did this was to make them user-friendly for Q & A

1. In the top right of the screen, click **Pin Visual**.

    ![](../Images/new-create-publish-powerbi-march-22.png)

1. To pin a visual to the **VanArsdel** dashboard in Power BI, select **Existing dashboard** **(1)** under the "Where would you like to pin to?" section, choose **VanArsdel** from the dropdown list **(2)**, and then click on **Pin** **(3)**.

    ![](../Images/atask3-step17.png)
    
1. Close the alert dialog boxes.

1. Click **Exit Q&A** from the upper left corner to navigate back to the dashboard.

    ![](../Images/new-create-publish-powerbi-march-23.png)

1. Notice that the visual is added as a tile to the dashboard, and clicking on the treemap visual will navigate you back to the Q&A section

    ![](../Images/new-create-publish-powerbi-march-24.png)

    > 📌 **Note:** Power BI quickly searches different subsets of your dataset while applying a set of sophisticated algorithms to discover potentially interesting insights. You can run insights against a dataset or a dashboard tile.

1. Let’s generate insights on a dashboard tile. When we run insights on a dashboard tile, instead of searching for insights against an entire dataset, the search is narrowed to the data used to create a single dashboard tile. This is often referred to as scoped insights.

1. Hover over the **line chart** on the dashboard.

1. Click the **ellipsis (...) (1)** on the top right corner and then click **View Insights (2)**.

    ![](../Images/pb50.png)
  
1. You will be navigated to **Focus mode** for the line chart.

1. Scroll through the Insights panel to explore the various insights Power BI can generate, and notice the option to pin these insight visuals directly to the dashboard..

    ![](../Images/pb51.png)

1. Click **Exit Focus mode** in the top left to navigate back to the dashboard.

    ![](../Images/image303.png)

1. We want to be notified when VanArsdel’s Market Share goes above or below a threshold. We can set up alerts to achieve this.

1. Hover over the **VanArsdel Market Share** tile, then click the **ellipsis (...) (1)** in the top right corner of the tile. From the dropdown, select **Manage alerts (2)** to open the **Manage alerts** dialog box.

    ![](../Images/new-create-publish-powerbi-march-025.png)

1. On the **Manage alerts** page, click **+ Add alert rule (1)** to open the dialog, then click **Cancel (2)** since we are not creating an alert rule.

    ![02](../Images/image304.png)
  
    > 📌 **Note:** Notice that you can add **Above** or **Below threshold**. You can also set the notification frequency. This is just an introduction to managing alerts. Complete functionality is not covered in this lab.

1. From the **Unsaved changes** pop-up window, click **Don’t save** to discard any changes made.

   ![alt text](../Images/11.png)

1. Click the **VanArsdel Market Share** tile on the dashboard to navigate directly to the corresponding report view.

   ![02](../Images/12.png)

1. In the map visual, click on the upwards arrow **↑ (1)** to select the Country level, right-click the **Australia (2)** bubble, click **Drill through (3)** and click then **By Manufacturer (4)**.

1. Click **Back to report**.

    ![alt text](../Images/image311.png)
  
1. From the top right menu, click **Bookmarks (1)** and then click **Show more bookmarks (2)**. The **Bookmark** pane opens on the right. There are two options: **Personal** bookmarks and **Report** bookmarks.

    - **Report bookmarks** are the bookmarks the report author created (we did this in Power BI Desktop).

    - **Personal bookmarks** on the report are ones which the consumer can create on their own.

      ![](../Images/image312.png)

1. From the **Bookmarks** pane, click **Report bookmarks (1)**, then select **View (2)** to browse through the list of **available bookmarks (3)**.

    ![](../Images/pb58.png)  

    > 📌 **Note:** Notice that you can view and navigate through the bookmarks using the arrow at the bottom of the screen. This behavior is like that in Power BI Desktop.

    ![](../Images/pr30.png)          
  
1. Click **Exit** in the **Bookmark** pane to close it.

    ![](../Images/pb59.png)

1. Click **View insights**.

    ![](../Images/pb61.png)
  
    > 📌 **Note:** A quick insights report is displayed based on the dataset. This provides insights into data you may have missed and helps to get a quick start on creating dashboards. Hovering over each report provides an option to **Pin it** to a dashboard.

    ![](../Images/powerbinew_task3_step43.png)  

Throughout this lab, you have learned how to apply conditional formatting, add a logo to the manufacturer filter, import a custom visual, and apply a custom theme to the report. You also learned how to add bookmarks to tell a story about the report.
